# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-with-Keras

Deep learning is here to stay! It's the go-to technique to solve complex problems that arise with unstructured data and an incredible tool for innovation. As a student who has dived into this field, I found Keras to be a crucial framework that made it easier for me to embark on the journey of developing deep learning models. 

Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to learn regression, predicting asteroid trajectories to contribute to Earth's preservation. I delved into binary classification, distinguishing real from fake dollar bills, and engaged in multiclass classification, solving the mystery of who threw which dart at the dartboard. Exploring the artistic side, I learned to use neural networks to reconstruct noisy images and much more. The course also equipped me with the knowledge to better control my models during training and fine-tune them for enhanced performance.
